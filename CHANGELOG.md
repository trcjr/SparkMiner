## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3 support** - ESP32-S3 with 128x64 OLED, LoRa SX1262

# Changelog

All notable changes to SparkMiner will be documented in this file.

## [v2.9.3] - 2026-01-22

### Added
- **Heltec Wireless Paper v1.1 support** - ESP32-S3 with 2.13" E-Ink display (~278 KH/s)
- New build environments: `wireless-paper` and `wireless-paper-headless`
- E-Ink display driver with partial refresh for display durability

### Fixed
- Typo in platformio.ini comments ("monocrhome" → "monochrome")

## [v2.9.2] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- **Stratum Proxy Stats Integration**: Pool hashrate, worker hashrate, difficulty adjustment via custom stats API
- `workerHashrate` field in `live_stats_t` and `display_data_t` structs
- Pool total hashrate display in bottom info panel
- Difficulty retarget progress and expected change % display

### Changed
- Stats grid layout: "Pool HR" renamed to "Workers" showing user's combined miner hashrate
- Bottom panel now shows pool total hashrate
- Extended stats API response parsing for pool and difficulty stats

### Fixed
- Worker visibility on pools - `mining.submit` now uses full `wallet.workername` from authorization

## [v2.9.1] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed
- Display settings (brightness, rotation, invert) now apply immediately after WiFi portal save
- WiFi portal dropdown values not syncing to form on selection
- SSID auto-fill when clicking scanned network names
- ArduinoJson memory optimization for network hashrate API

### Added
- Timezone support with configurable UTC offset (-12 to +14)
- Network hashrate and difficulty stats from mempool.space
- HTTPS stats proxy with SSL bumping support

## [v2.9.0] - 2026-01-08

### Added
- U8g2 OLED display support for SSD1306 displays (9cbec10)
- Display abstraction layer and ESP32-C3 single-core support (c24634e)
- LED status driver and LILYGO T-Display support (50513d9)

### Changed
- Updated README with ESP32-C3 and OLED board support (4081c9b)

## [v2.8.0] - 2025-01-07

### Added
- Persistent mining statistics (NVS storage)
- SD card stats backup (/stats.json)
- Color-coded status indicators (temp, WiFi, ping)
- Unified devtool.py for build/flash/monitor
- Friendly firmware naming (cyd-1usb, cyd-2usb, etc.)
- Cloudflare Worker for HTTPS stats API (optional)

### Changed
- Firmware filenames now use friendly board names
- Display shows lifetime totals instead of session-only stats
- devtool.py replaces flash.py and build_release.py

### Fixed
- Struct alignment padding causing stats checksum failures
- WiFi portal not opening when SD has stats but no config
- COM port handling after device reset

### Removed
- flash.py, flash.bat (use devtool.py instead)

## [v2.7.0] - 2025-01-06

### Fixed
- **Critical memory leak** in live_stats.cpp - changed `DynamicJsonDocument` to `StaticJsonDocument<2048>` to prevent heap fragmentation
- **WiFi client memory leak** - replaced `new/delete WiFiClientSecure` with stack-allocated clients
- **Stratum heap fragmentation** - converted `String` members in `stratum_job_t` to fixed char arrays
- **Headless build failure** - added conditional SD card support for boards without SD slots

### Changed
- Stratum job parsing now uses `strncpy` to fixed-size buffers instead of Arduino `String`
- Enhanced heap monitoring with Min/MaxAlloc tracking
- Updated documentation with accurate hashrate measurements (~715-725 KH/s for CYD)

### Added
- Comprehensive board compatibility documentation (`docs/Compatible-Boards-Research.md`)
- Support for 7 ESP32/ESP32-S3 board variants

### Improved
- Memory stability - heap now stays stable at ~168KB during operation
- Share acceptance rate (tested at 70/70 during development)
